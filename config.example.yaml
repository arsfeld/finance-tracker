# Transaction Filter Configuration
# This file defines rules for filtering out specific transactions from analysis.
# Filtered transactions will be excluded from the LLM analysis but will be
# included in a summary section for reference.

# Excluded Transactions
# Each rule consists of:
#   - pattern: The text to match in the transaction description
#   - match_type: How to match the pattern (substring, prefix, or suffix)
#
# Match Types:
#   - substring: Matches if the pattern appears anywhere in the description (case-insensitive)
#   - prefix: Matches if the description starts with the pattern (case-insensitive)
#   - suffix: Matches if the description ends with the pattern (case-insensitive)

excluded_transactions:
  # Filter out all Amazon transactions (substring match)
  - pattern: "Amazon"
    match_type: "substring"

  # Filter out Venmo transactions
  - pattern: "Venmo"
    match_type: "substring"

  # Filter out PayPal transactions
  - pattern: "PayPal"
    match_type: "substring"

  # Filter out ACH transfers (prefix match)
  - pattern: "ACH"
    match_type: "prefix"

  # Filter out wire transfers (prefix match)
  - pattern: "WIRE"
    match_type: "prefix"

  # Filter out fee transactions (suffix match)
  - pattern: "FEE"
    match_type: "suffix"

  # Filter out ATM withdrawals
  - pattern: "ATM"
    match_type: "substring"

# Usage:
# 1. Copy this file to config.yaml: cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# 2. Edit config.yaml to add your specific filter rules
# 3. Set the FILTER_CONFIG_PATH environment variable in your .env file:
#    FILTER_CONFIG_PATH=config.yaml
# 4. Run finance_tracker as usual
#
# Notes:
# - All pattern matching is case-insensitive
# - Patterns are matched against the transaction description field
# - Filtered transactions are shown in a summary but excluded from analysis
# - If the config file path is not set or the file doesn't exist, no filtering is applied
